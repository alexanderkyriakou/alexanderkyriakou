## Hola explorer! :world_map::compass::mountain_snow:

I'm an experienced Technical SEO, with a focus on website auditing. Have worked and played with various CMS (WP, Magento, Joomla, Drupal), as well with LMS (Moodle). I could describe me as an occasional developer, who believes in a no/low-code future where personalised code development is widely accessible. I've a soft spot for data management, which begun when creating custom Looker Studio reports and playing around with Tableau.

Always learning something new, currently exploring the topics...

- Image generation via ComfyUI
- Advanced DAX and Power Query
- Azure
